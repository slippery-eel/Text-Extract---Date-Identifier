# Web Data Mining Tools
For several projects that I have worked on at Inventive, I've needed to organize our work related to several thousand Texas A&M webpages.

For example, there was a statement of work that needed to be done for all News Artciles on a certain website, but the News Articles on this site were unorganized and not identifiable with just a URL. So I made a script that could search through our web crawl (csv file of webpages) and identify a specific date pattern that only exists on those News Articles. This saved us many hours of manual labor.

This, plus several other scripts were coded and implemented by myself in order to automate similar manual tasks.
